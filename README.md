The Acceleration Wand mod adds a powerful tool to Minecraft that allows you to accelerate the tick speed of blocks. Perfect for speeding up crops, machines, and other random ticking blocks in your world, the wand offers multiple modes for various gameplay needs.

Features
Multiple Acceleration Modes:

Normal: Default acceleration speed.

Fast: A faster acceleration mode.

Slow: Slows down acceleration for finer control.

Durability and Crafting: The wand has limited durability and can be crafted using a specific recipe. It can be repaired or replaced as necessary.

Visual and Sound Effects:

When using the wand, enjoy particles and sound effects for a more immersive experience.

Mode Toggle: Easily switch between different modes with a simple keypress of M.

How It Works
Using the Wand:

Right-click on blocks to accelerate their tick rates. It works on blocks that support random ticking or are specifically marked for acceleration (like crops and certain machines).

Mode Switching:

Shift-right-click to cycle between different modes (Normal, Fast, Slow), allowing you to control how much the wand accelerates the ticks and how quickly it drains durability.
